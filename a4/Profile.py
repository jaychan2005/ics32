# YOU DO NOT NEED TO READ OR UNDERSTAND THE JSON SERIALIZATION ASPECTS OF THIS CODE 
# RIGHT NOW, though can you certainly take a look at it if you are curious since we

    The Profile class exposes the properties required to join an ICS 32 DSU server. You

    functions in this class as you will need to make use of each of them in your program.

    When creating your program you will need to collect user input for the properties 
    exposed by this class. A Profile class should ensure that a username and password 
    are set, but contains no conventions to do so. You should make sure that your code
